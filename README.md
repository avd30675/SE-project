## Project Objective
- The objective of this project is to create a web-based application to manage classroom bookings, Hostels booking, Seminar Halls booking, Guest room booking, and sports booking at NITK.
- The purpose of this project is to reduce manual work with papers and documents.
## Project Description
The project is aimed to minimize the manual work, the number of people involved, and paperwork while booking a guest room, seminar hall, or a classroom in the institution. It also extends to features like booking a sports court and selecting a mess of the user's preference (once per month).

The project will be a web-based portal to make the booking system accessible on the go, making it multi-device compatible.
The project is intended for the people of the Institution with a valid username and password provided by the institute. A user can access the portal's functionalities only after authentication of username and password.On the other hand, admin will have the authority to accept or reject the booking slot request from student or faculty.
